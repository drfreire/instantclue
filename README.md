- [x] User definable settings
- [x] Responsive User Interface
- [x] Computational expensive task on Thread

- [x] Categorica values can now be encoded by different markers in settings
- [x] Categorical countplot. 
- [x] Grouping of columns to perform row-wise statistical tests. Groups are highligted in dimensional reduction plots as well as correlation matrix plots.
- [ ] Creating log (saving version and processing of data as well as creation of charts)


### Quick Select and Live Graph Widget

The two newly implemented widgets "QuickSelect" and "LiveGraph" intend to accelarete visual anlytics in InstantClue. An illustration of the functionality is shown below and [this video]() demonstrates usage.

## Get Started 

Executable binary files are available at the [website](http://www.instantclue.uni-koeln.de) for Mac OS and Windows.
We recommend using the development snapshots as they are equipped with more features and recent bug reports, but may contain non-functional widgets or context menu functions.

### Source Code
First download the code and extract it. Open terminal (mac) or command line tool (windows) and navigate to instantclue/src/main/python
Then create a virtual environment using 

```
python3 -m venv env #mac 
source env/bin/activate # activate env
```
or 
```
py -m venv env #windows
.\env\Scripts\activate
```
Then use the requirements.txt file to install packages and finally start InstantClue.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt #install packages

python3 main.py #starts InstantClue
```

## Builds 

From now on we are publishing development version builds to give faster acess to the users. Builds are available at [GitHub](https://github.com/hnolCol/instantclue/releases). The official website will only host the latest version.
